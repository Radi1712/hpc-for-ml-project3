# hpc-for-ml-project3
This repository contains the third of three group projects from the course "High Performance Computing for Machine Learning" during my Master's studies. The task was to implement, train and evaluate a GatedPINN for the one-dimensional heat equation and compare its performance to a regular single global PINN which was implemented in the first project of this course. All of the work can be found in the [project03.ipynb](https://github.com/Radi1712/hpc-for-ml-project3/blob/main/project03.ipynb) notebook which contains the implementation of the single global PINN and respective figures from project 1 as well as the implementation of the GatedPINN and its respective figures from project 3 at the bottom. All findings were discussed in the [project report](https://github.com/Radi1712/hpc-for-ml-project3/blob/main/report.pdf).
